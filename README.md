This is a non-commercial portfolio project, meaning it is not for profit. Although its concept is simple, the main objective was to test some different mechanics such as:

    A new form of "self-managing componentization," making it modular;
    Experiments with SpriteLibrary and animations;
    Implementation of a RESTful API with NodeJS and MySQL;

**NOTE: I do not have any active servers at the moment, so the API part will not be testable unless you install MySQL Server 8 on your machine and create a local database.
In another repository, I will provide the NodeJS API project and a database dump.**
